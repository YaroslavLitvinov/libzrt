libzrt project is an experimental hypervisor uses seccomp sandboxing.
components of libzrt.so:
1. libc library - some sort of glibc library statically linked into
shared library and not depends on generic glibc provided by
linux. This library has own implementation of subset of syscalls which
can be used instead of standard syscalls; Sources is derived from
zerovm/zrt, zerovm/glibc projects.
2. zvm3.so - which is dynamically linked with libzrt.so and giving
some functions that allow to support zerovm manifest file. Sources are
derived from zerovm/zerovm project;
3. seccomp engine - disallow direct syscalls executing except read,
write, exit, sighandler; It's setup handler intercepting
linux syscalls and replacing it by alternative implementation from item #1;
